      <description>Are you a biologist with more data than you know what to do with? Do you wish you were more familiar with common programming methods for the life sciences?
Then come and join CodeOn! We’re a community of data science learners committed to developing computational skills among Keck students.  We’re starting off the Spring 2019 semester with an introduction to the R programming language. We’ll be hosting gatherings every other week.</description>
