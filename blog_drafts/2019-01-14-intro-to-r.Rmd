Are you a biologist with more data than you know what to do with? 
Do you wish you were more familiar with common programming methods for the life sciences? 

#### Then come and join [CodeOn!](https://keckcodeon.github.io) We're a community of data science learners committed to developing computational skills among Keck students. 

## We're starting off the Spring 2019 semester with an introduction to the R programming language. We'll be hosting gatherings every other week. Details below!
